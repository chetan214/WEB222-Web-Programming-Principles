            <h2><data>Summary</data></h2>
            <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki — Considered one of the best personal finance books of all time, this book compares Kiyosaki's financial philosophies learned from his two key mentors: his "Poor Dad" (biological father) and "Rich Dad" (best friend's father). His high education and stable government job yet still struggling financially Poor Dad teaches job security and talks a lot about danger security Rich dad, on the other hand, is also not well-educated but has been super successful in business and in getting money work for him through owning income-producing assets while keeping secured from over-leveraged liabilities according to Kiyosaki. A return to the classroom But does that mean we should take financial lessons out the classroom that is teaching them or are there still valuable lessons here Highly likely, starting with the recognition of how undervalued traditional schooling has made a good, solid financial education: learning what an asset is (puts money in your pocket) and what a liability is (takes money out), minding your own business by creating personal wealth either as an investor or entrepreneur born from identifying this important lesson: work for learning - not earning. Kiyosaki also confronts the everyday financial problems of fear, cynicism, and bad habits and then provides strong reasons on how to build confidence, drive motivation, and stay consistently engaged in continuous learning. Using these principles, the book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" challenges conventional financial wisdom and encourages people to reconsider their views/mindset on money, building wealth in long term and how they could become financially independent. Its teachings have since shaped the ideals of countless others who have abandoned the idea of a career as an employee in favor of its ethos — financial freedom and intelligent investing, marking it out as a classic that continues to point novice learners down paths towards economic self-determination.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Financial Education: </em></strong>Essential yet often neglected in formal education, understanding how money works is crucial for financial success.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Assets vs. Liabilities: </em></strong>To build wealth, invest in assets that generate income (like real estate and stocks) rather than liabilities that incur expenses (like cars and homes).</li>
                <li><strong><em>Mind Your Own Business: </em></strong>Focus on building and managing personal assets rather than relying solely on a job for income.</li>
                <li><strong><em>The Power of Corporations: </em></strong>Use the legal and tax advantages of corporations to protect and grow wealth</li> 
                <li><strong><em>Work to Learn, Not to Earn: </em></strong>Seek jobs that offer valuable skills and experiences over high salaries, building a foundation for future financial success.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
           <p> <blockquote>
              This book had a significant impact on my beliefs about money and retirement. This also brought to light the absence of real life finance knowledge in traditional schooling and the need for financial literacy. This changed my approach to money and redefined how I saw assets and liabilities, Which in turn shaped practically every decision I made from a financial standpoint towards building wealth for the long term. The lessons on the value of entrepreneurship and the role corporations can play both strategically and competitively got me to start thinking about other ways to secure money than working at a traditional job.</blockquote></p>
